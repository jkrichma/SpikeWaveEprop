spikeWaveEprop.m - spike wave propagation algorithm that generates a path given a start and end destination. Uses eProp algorithm from Bellec et al., to learn the map and cost of traversal.

tolmanDetour.m - an example from the paper to run the spike wave eprop algorithm.

alvernhe_coords.txt - maze from the original Tolman detour task. Used in the Alvernhe et al., paper
